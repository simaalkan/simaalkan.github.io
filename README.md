💭 Hi, I'm Sima.

✨ I have over 3 years of experience as a Business Analyst and QA Engineer. 

🔭 Currently, I am focusing on upskilling my automation and performance testing abilities and planning to practice AI testing as well.

🦄 I have a proven ability to be detail-oriented, efficient in test execution, and clear in documentation. I am capable of handling complex technical challenges and adapting to new technologies. My combined perspective as both a BA and QA helps bridge communication gaps within teams.

⚡ I truly enjoy testing and finding bugs. I'm a reliable bug catcher, which earned me the nickname: the last bug bender. 

📍 I'm from Türkiye and have been living in Gdańsk, Poland since 2024.
🎓 I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering at Bilkent University.
